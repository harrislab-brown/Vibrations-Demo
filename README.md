# Vibrations-Demo
The goal of this project is to create a reconfigurable laboratory kit that is designed to be used as part of a first undergraduate course in mechanical vibrations. The kit was designed to be low-cost and allow for a series of laboratory experiments to be performed remotely. Using a common set of core hardware and software, five laboratory experiments are detailed and can be performed to supplement many of the major topics traditionally encountered in a first vibrations course. 

This repository contains:
1. Assignments: Sample student lab assignments which detail how each demo might be used in the classroom. Each assignment subfolder also contains a video of each demo.
2. CAD files: All files of components needed to be manufactured using 3D printing are provided in both step and stl format. 
3. Laser cut files: All files of components needed to be manufactured by laser cutting are provided in step format.
4. Mechanical drawings: Mechanical drawings of components that need to be manufactured by alternative methods (simple metal working). 
5. Software: All software used in the project (MATLAB GUI, Octave Tone Generator, and Arduino code for accelerometer) are provided. 
6. Vibrations kit assembly guide: A step-by-step guide to assembly and manufacturing of each kit.
7. Vibrations kit BOM: Bill of materials with suggested url for purchasing.
